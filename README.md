# CSIT314 Final Project (Spring 2023)

This code is for an application called iLearn, which helps students, teachers, and parents with their learning experience.

Users can sign up and log in to iLearn with different roles, like students, teachers, or parents.

The code has classes to represent users (like students, teachers, and parents), applications, and utility functions.

Each user has a username, password, and email. Students and teachers have additional properties like student ID and teacher ID.

Applications in iLearn have names, types, and authors.

The utility class helps manage students and teachers.

The main class, iLearnSystem, handles user registration, login, and different actions based on roles.

Users can add or remove applications, view student or teacher information, and validate email addresses.

The program provides a command-line interface for users to interact with iLearn.

Users can log in, sign up, and perform actions based on their role.
